# F1_Performance_Prediction

#Project Overview
The purpose of the project is to predicts F1 lap times based on track conditions and weather and analyzes pit stop strategies for optimization. Inspired by Palantir Foundryâ€™s approach, the project unifies data sources, simulates race scenarios, and visualizes driver momentum. Heavy on Data Science concepts.

#Goal of the Project:
There were many different ideas I could've decided to work on regarding F1 but here are three main goals:
- Build a predictive model for lap times, factoring in weather and track conditions.
- Analyze optimal pit stop strategies and simulate different race outcomes.
- Visualize driver and team momentum over a season.

### Repository Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data cleaning and reusable functions.
- `output/`: Final results, visualizations, and simulation outputs.

# F1_Performance_Prediction
The purpose of the project is to predicts F1 lap times based on track conditions and weather and analyzes pit stop strategies for optimization. Inspired by Palantir Foundryâ€™s approach, the project unifies data sources, simulates race scenarios, and visualizes driver momentum. Heavy on Data Science concepts.
